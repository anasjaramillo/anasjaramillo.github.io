# About Me

Hello! I'm Ana Jaramillo, a dedicated Biology major and Mathematics & Statistics minor at Pomona College. I am deeply interested in the scientific research process, but have started to focus my research specialty on data analysis and computational biology. I've developed statistical models, analyzed large genomic datasets, and collaborated across disciplines to uncover insights into complex biological systems–such as discovering drug targets for parasitic diseases and differential bacterial/fungal microbial analyses. Through my work, I aim to bridge the worlds of computation and biological research, uncovering new knowledge and contributing to meaningful change in healthcare and genomic computational biology.

## Current Projects

I am currently working on a research manuscript for my senior thesis, which I hope to publish upon completion. My project focuses on investigating differential microbial assemblages in the soil beneath five native California sagescrub plant species. This research explores the microbial diversity unique to each plant species and investigates how proximity to urban boundaries—an aspect known as the "edge effect"—influences the composition of these microbial communities. By examining edge and central soil samples, I aim to uncover how human-influenced environmental factors might alter microbial ecosystems in these natural settings.

To achieve this, I am conducting a bioinformatics analysis on the genomic data of both fungal and bacterial assemblages. Working with tools such as Jupyter Notebook and Python, I process and analyze large genomic data sets to identify patterns and draw meaningful insights. This analysis involves a variety of computational techniques, including data cleaning, genomic sequencing alignment, and community composition visualization, providing me with hands-on experience in advanced bioinformatics workflows.
