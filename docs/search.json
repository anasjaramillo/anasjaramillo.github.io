    "text": "Hello! I’m Ana Jaramillo, a dedicated Biology major and Mathematics & Statistics minor at Pomona College. My passion for scientific exploration has driven me to work on a range of projects, from bioinformatics research at the University of Melbourne to ecological restoration at the Bernard Field Station. I am deeply interested in the scientific research process, but have started to focus my research specialty on data analysis and computational biology. I’ve developed statistical models, analyzed large genomic datasets, and collaborated across disciplines to uncover insights into complex biological systems–such as discovering drug targets for parasitic diseases and differential bacterial/fungal microbial analyses. As a teaching assistant, I guided students in data analysis and lab techniques, nurturing the next generation of scientific thinkers. Through my work, I aim to bridge the worlds of data and biology, uncovering new knowledge and contributing to meaningful change in healthcare and genomic computational biology.\n\n\nI am currently working on a research manuscript for my senior thesis, which I hope to publish upon completion. My project focuses on investigating differential microbial assemblages in the soil beneath five native California sagescrub plant species. This research explores the microbial diversity unique to each plant species and investigates how proximity to urban boundaries—an aspect known as the “edge effect”—influences the composition of these microbial communities. By examining edge and central soil samples, I aim to uncover how human-influenced environmental factors might alter microbial ecosystems in these natural settings.\nTo achieve this, I am conducting a bioinformatics analysis on the genomic data of both fungal and bacterial assemblages. Working with tools such as Jupyter Notebook and Python, I process and analyze large genomic datasets to identify patterns and draw meaningful insights. This analysis involves a variety of computational techniques, including data cleaning, genomic sequencing alignment, and community composition visualization, providing me with hands-on experience in advanced bioinformatics workflows.\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Melbourne Bioinformatics Research Project\nAs a research intern, I immersed myself in a project that examined gene expression patterns in Schistosoma haematobium, a parasitic organism with significant health impacts in endemic regions. This experience challenged me to bridge my biological knowledge with computational analysis, as I developed and implemented over 12 statistical models in R to interpret and visualize genomic data for over 10,000 sequences. I used the HISAT2 alignment program on the Galaxy platform to map gene expression levels across sex chromosomes, an innovative approach that broadened my understanding of bioinformatics workflows. Working alongside graduate and Ph.D. researchers, I gained firsthand experience in interdisciplinary collaboration, where I learned to refine protocols, troubleshoot data issues, and maintain data accuracy across large datasets. Presenting our findings at an international symposium was a transformative moment, teaching me to distill complex data insights into accessible, impactful narratives for a diverse scientific audience.\nSummer Undergraduate Research Program at Pomona College\nThis research experience was pivotal in expanding my understanding of ecological research design and data management. I led the sample collection and protocol design for a project exploring ecological interactions across five Southern Californian ecosystems, emphasizing precision in data collection to minimize variance across sites. I was responsible for transforming raw field data into a meaningful story that could contribute to the scientific community’s understanding of these unique environments. My contribution to our publication in Diversity included not only statistical analysis but also creating detailed data visualizations that underscored key ecological patterns and implications. Presenting our findings at academic conferences reinforced my ability to communicate scientific data visually and verbally, allowing me to advocate for ecological preservation through accessible, evidence-based presentations.\nRobert J. Bernard Field Station Research\nAt the Bernard Field Station, I engaged deeply with research on plant-soil feedback mechanisms and the ecological impact of native and invasive species, a project that aligned with my passion for biodiversity conservation. Working as a Restoration Technician, I conducted methodical data collection across 12 plots, analyzed microbial interactions, and tested soil nutrient levels. This experience brought home the importance of rigorous, repeatable research practices in ecological restoration, where every detail impacts our understanding of ecosystem health. Our team’s publication illuminated the complex interdependencies between plants, soil, and microbial communities, with my contributions to data visualization capturing the intricate relationships that promote ecosystem resilience. This project was instrumental in teaching me the real-world applications of ecological research, from laboratory techniques like DNA extraction to statistical methods that unveil hidden patterns in complex ecological datasets.\n\n\n\n\n\nCell Chemistry and Cell Biology Lab Teaching Assistant\n\nAs a Laboratory Teaching Assistant, I guided over 30 students in mastering core techniques of data analysis, visualization, and lab procedures. In this role, I emphasized precision and analytical thinking, helping students transform raw data into clear, scientifically sound reports. Leading hands-on sessions, I taught methods like western blotting, gel electrophoresis, and spectroscopy, instilling in students the importance of careful data handling. By fostering collaborative learning and critical problem-solving, I helped students build confidence in both their technical skills and their ability to interpret and present data—a foundation essential for future research and professional success.\nSkills: Western blotting, SDS-Page, agarose gel electrophoresis, spectroscopy, PCR, DNA Sequencing, DNA extraction & purification, immunofluorescence, cell culturing, transfection and transformation, knockout techniques, co-immunoprecipitation, spectroscopy, distillation, enzyme kinetic assays\n\n\n\nPosse Foundation Full-Tuition Leadership Scholarship (2021 - 2025) 1for2 Foundation “Pay-it-Forward” Scholarship ($14,700 – 2021-2025) Institute for Study Abroad Scholarship—Melbourne, Australia: Academic Year (2023) Taco Bell Live Mas Video Scholarship ($10,000 – 2021; $10,000 – 2023) 2 Published Research Articles (2022 – 2023) Hispanic Scholarship Fund Scholar (2020 – 2023)"

As the show follows multiple characters, there is some debate as to who exactly the main character is. As such, I have decided to count the amount of words spoken by each character per season to better understand who the show writers center most. Additionally, as a young adult show, there is some occasional cussing which occurs throughout. Here, I have quantified the percentage of the show script which involves cussing to see how much of the show involves potty-mouth humor.\n\n# Data\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nofficelines &lt;- read_csv(\"the-office_lines.csv\")\n\n# Cleaning Data\nofficelines &lt;- officelines |&gt;\nmutate(Line = str_to_lower(Line))\n\nlines &lt;- officelines$Line\nlines &lt;- str_remove_all(lines, \"[[:punct:]]\")\n\nofficelines &lt;- officelines |&gt;\nselect(Character, Line, Season, Episode_Number) |&gt;\nmutate(Line = lines) \n\n\nGraph 1 (Who says the most words per season?)\nCleaning data:\n\n# Homogenizing the lines\nwords_per_char &lt;- officelines |&gt;\nmutate(word_count = lengths(str_split(Line, \"\\\\s+\"))) |&gt;\ngroup_by(Character, Season) |&gt;\nsummarize(total_words = sum(word_count))\n\n#Keeping only Main Characters & Cleaning Data\nmain_characters &lt;- c(\"Michael\", \"Jim\", \"Pam\", \"Dwight\", \"Andy\", \"Ryan\", \"Robert\")\n\nwords_dont_keep &lt;- c(\"Voicemail\", \"Mom\", \"Dad\", \"Ad\", \"Fake\", \"Except\", \"Church\")\n\nword_pattern_keep &lt;- paste0(\"\\\\b(\", paste(main_characters, collapse = \"|\"), \")\\\\b\")\n\nword_pattern_delete &lt;- paste0(\"\\\\b(\", paste(words_dont_keep, collapse = \"|\"), \")\\\\b\")\n\nget_rid_ands &lt;- \"\\\\s&\\\\s|\\\\sAnd\\\\s|/|,\\\\s\"\n\nwords_per_char &lt;- words_per_char |&gt;\nfilter(str_detect(Character, word_pattern_keep)) |&gt;\nfilter(!str_detect(Character, word_pattern_delete)) |&gt;\nmutate(Character = str_replace_all(Character, get_rid_ands, \", \")) |&gt;\nseparate_rows(Character, sep = \", \") |&gt;\nfilter(str_detect(Character, word_pattern_keep)) |&gt;\nmutate(Character = case_when(\nstr_detect(Character, \"\\\\bJim\\\\b\") ~ \"Jim\",\nstr_detect(Character, \"\\\\bPam\\\\b\") ~ \"Pam\",\nstr_detect(Character, \"\\\\bDwight\\\\b\") ~ \"Dwight\",\nstr_detect(Character, \"\\\\bMichael\\\\b\") ~ \"Michael\",\nstr_detect(Character, \"\\\\bAndy\\\\b\") ~ \"Andy\",\nstr_detect(Character, \"\\\\bRobert\\\\b\") ~ \"Robert\", str_detect(Character, \"\\\\bRyan\\\\b\") ~ \"Ryan\")) |&gt;\ngroup_by(Character, Season) |&gt;\nsummarise(total_words = sum(total_words), .groups = 'drop') \n\n\n\nFinally!

Though this data visualization, you can see that Michael is the character who speaks the most (word-wise) throughout seasons 1-7. He was not present in season 8 & 9 (denoted by a lack of words). The character with the second most words throughout seasons 1-8 (except for season 4) is Dwight, who ends up having the most words in season 9. In season 8, Andy has the most words. On average Robert has no words per season, except for a slight amount of words in season 7 and more words in season 8. Ryan also has very few words throughout the show but is consistently present unlike Robert. The legend shows a color-coded labeling system for each of the main character.

    "text": "Option A: Conducting Permutation Test\nData was sourced from [Real Estate Valuation](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/477/real+estate+valuation+data+set) from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository by I-Cheng Yeh\nThis dataset shows the historical market of real estate valuation collected from Sindian Dist., New Taipei City, Taiwan. It has many interesting variables to compare–features of homes that may increase or decrease its valuation. In particular, distance from homes to the nearest MRT station interested me, as Taiwan has an extensive public transport system; MRT being one of the most popular.\nAs such, it wouldn’t be a far fetch to believe a home’s distance from an MRT station might increase valuation. As such, we might like to test the correlation between these variables to understand how significant MRT distance truly is to Taiwan’s real estate market.\nResearch Question: Is there a significant association between distance from the nearest MRT station and house price per unit area in Taiwan?\nNull Hypothesis: There is no association between the distance to the nearest MRT station and house price per unit area.\nAlternative Hypothesis: There is an association between the distance to the nearest MRT station and house price per unit area.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(readxl)\n\n# Data\nreal_estate &lt;- read_excel(\"C:/Users/anaja/Downloads/Real estate valuation data set.xlsx\")\n\nLet’s start by visualizing. I have started by plotting a graph with the dataset’s original values for MRT distance and their associated price per unit area. Clearly, the slope is pretty negative, perhaps showing that the farther a home is from an MRT station, the less expensive the price per unit area.\nHowever, how much of this is due to random chance? Could it be that all these MRT distance data points lined up just right to show a negative relationship?\nLets try to rearrange the MRT distance data randomly to see if we get the same relationship. To do so, we are sampling the existing MRT distances and assigning them randomly to house price per unit area. As we can see, the linear model shows a much more neutral slope.\n\n# Linear regression of Normal MRT Distance to House Price per Unit Area\nreal_estate |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = distance_MRT, y = house_price_unit)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(x = \"Distance from MRT (meters)\", y = \"House Price of Unit Area\",\n       y = \"House Price of Unit Area\",\n       title = \"MRT Distances to House Price per Unit Area\" ) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Linear regression of Randomly Sampled MRT Distances to House Price per Unit Area\nset.seed(47)\nreal_estate |&gt;\n    mutate(random_MRT = sample(distance_MRT)) |&gt;\n    ggplot(aes(x = random_MRT, y = house_price_unit)) +\n    geom_point() +\n  labs(x = \"Distance from MRT (meters)\", y = \"House Price of Unit Area\",\n       title = \"Randomly Sampled MRT Distances to House Price per Unit Area\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut how much can we really trust our eyes? Lets get some numerical data to back up our claim. Here, we calculate the observed slope’s coefficient to numerically understand how much of a difference we see in slopes.\n\n# Getting the observed slope for original data and plot\nobserved_model &lt;- lm(house_price_unit ~ distance_MRT, data = real_estate)\nobserved_slope &lt;- coef(observed_model)[[\"distance_MRT\"]]\n\nobserved_slope\n\n[1] -0.007262052\n\n# Running Permutation Test with slope for Null Hypothesis\nset.seed(47)\n\npermuted_MRT_prices &lt;- function(real_estate) {\n  real_estate &lt;- real_estate |&gt;\n    mutate(random_MRT = sample(distance_MRT))\n  model_random_MRT &lt;- lm(house_price_unit ~ random_MRT, data = real_estate)\n  return(coef(model_random_MRT)[[\"random_MRT\"]])\n}\n\npermuted_MRT_prices(real_estate)\n\n[1] 0.0005357146\n\n\nOkay, but that was just ONE instance of reshuffling. Maybe this was all chance!

In all, it seems that proximity to MRT stations plays a significant role in Taiwan’s house valuation. The original data set’s negative relationship is shown to be significantly different from the 1000 iterations of permutations tested with randomized data.\nCitation:\nYeh, I. (2018).

The subjects returned for four to eight sessions. Measurements were made at three ear-canal locations: a deep insertion depth (with a foam plug flush at the entrance to the ear canal) and both 3 and 6 mm more lateral to this deep insertion.\n\n\n Study sample: Repeated measurements on seven subjects are reported. All subjects were female, between 19 and 22 yr old, and enrolled at an undergraduate women’s college.\n\n\n Data collection and analysis:  Measurements on both the right and left ears were made at three ear-canal locations during each of four to eight measurement sessions. Random-effects regression models were used for the analysis to account for repeated measures within subjects. The mean power reflectance for each position over all sessions was calculated for each subject.\n\n\n Results:  The comparison of power reflectance from the left and right ears of an individual subject varied greatly over the seven subjects; the difference between the power reflectance measured on the left and that measured on the right was compared at 248 frequencies, and depending on the subject, the percentage of tested frequencies for which the left and right ears differed significantly ranged from 10% to 93% (some with left values greater than right values and others with the opposite pattern). Although the individual subjects showed left-right differences, the overall population generally did not show significant differences between the left and right ears. The mean power reflectance for each measurement position over all sessions depended on the location of the probe in the ear for frequencies of less than 1000 Hz. The standard deviation between subjects’ mean power reflectance after controlling for ear (left or right) was found to be greater than the standard deviation within the individual subject’s mean power reflectance. The intrasubject standard deviation in power reflectance was smallest at the deepest insertion depths.\n\n\n Conclusions:  All subjects had differences in power reflectance between their left and right ears at some frequencies; the percentage of frequencies at which differences occurred varied greatly across subjects. The intrasubject standard deviations were smallest for the deepest probe insertion depths, suggesting clinical measurements should be made with as deep an insertion as practically possible to minimize variability. This deep insertion will reduce both acoustic leaks and the effect of low-frequency ear-canal losses. The within-subject standard deviations were about half the magnitude of the overall standard deviations, quantifying the extent of intrasubject versus intersubject variability.\n\n” |Susan Voss |svoss@smith.edu |24-Aug-2016 |Measurements made on 7 subjects across multiple sessions and 3 probe locations for each subject.

J. Pediatr. Otorhinolaryngol. |https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23047065/ |\n\n Objective:  Presently, normative wideband reflectance data are available for neonates who have passed a distortion product otoacoustic emission test. However, passing the distortion product otoacoustic emission test alone does not ensure normal middle ear function. The objective of this study was to establish normative wideband reflectance data in healthy neonates with normal middle ear function, as justified by passing a battery of tests.\n\n\n Method:  Wideband reflectance was measured in 66 infants (mean age=46.0 h, SD=21.0, range=13.3-116.5h) who passed a test battery that included high frequency (1000 Hz) tympanometry, acoustic stapedial reflex, transient evoked otoacoustic emissions and distortion product otoacoustic emissions.\n\n\n Results:  The analysis of variance (ANOVA) results showed significant variations of reflectance across the frequencies. There was no significant difference between ears and genders. The median reflectance reached a minimum of 0.21-0.24 at 1-2 kHz, but increased to 0.45-0.59 below 1 kHz and 0.24-0.52 above 2 kHz.\n\n\n Conclusions:  The normative reflectance data established in the present study were in agreement with, but marginally smaller than, those of previous normative studies, except for the Keefe et al. (2000) study. While the use of a test battery approach to ensure normal middle ear function in neonates has resulted in slightly reduced reflectance across most frequencies when compared to studies that have used only otoacoustic emissions, further research is needed to accurately determine the middle ear status of neonates using test performance measures.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |Sreedevi Aithal   |Sreedevi.aithal@health.qld.gov.au |2-Jan-2023    |                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|Aithal_2014 | 2014|Sreedevi Aithal, Joseph Kei, and Carlie Driscoll |Aithal et al. |Wideband Absorbance in Young Infants (0–6 months): A Cross-Sectional Study |J Am Acad Audiol |https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25257721/ |\n\n Background:  Wideband acoustic immittance (WAI) studies on infants have shown changes in WAI measures with age. These changes are attributed, at least in part, to developmental effects. However, developmental effects in young infants (0-6 mo) on WAI have not been systematically investigated.\n\n\n Purpose:  The objective of this study was to compare wideband absorbance (WBA) in healthy neonates and infants aged 1, 2, 4, and 6 mo.\n\n\n Research Design:  This was a prospective cross-sectional study. All participants were assessed by using 1-kHz tympanometry, distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) tests, and WBA tests.\n\n\n Study Sample  Participants included 35 newborns (35 ears), 16 infants aged 1 mo (29 ears), 16 infants aged 2 mo (29 ears), 15 infants aged 4 mo (28 ears), and 14 infants aged 6 mo (27 ears). For each participant, the ears that passed both high-frequency (1-kHz) tympanometry and DPOAE tests were included for analysis.\n\n\n Data collection and analysis:  WBA was recorded at ambient pressure conditions, and the response consisted of 16 data points at 1/3-octave frequencies from 0.25 to 8 kHz. A mixed-model analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to the data in each age group to evaluate the effects of sex, ear, and frequency on WBA. WBA was compared between various age groups. In addition, a separate mixed-model ANOVA was applied to WBA data, and post hoc analyses with the Bonferroni correction were performed at each of the 16 data points at 1/3-octave frequencies across age groups to examine the effect of age on WBA.\n\n\n Results:  For all age groups, WBA was highest between 1.5 and 5 kHz and lowest at frequencies of less than 1.5 kHz and greater than 5 kHz. A developmental trend was evident, with both the 0- and 6-mo-old infants being significantly different from other age groups at most frequencies. The WBA results exhibited a multipeaked pattern for infants aged 0 to 2 mo, whereas a single broad peaked pattern for 4- and 6-mo-old infants was observed. The difference in WBA between 0- and 6-mo-old infants was statistically significant across most frequencies. In contrast, the WBA results for 1- and 2-mo-old infants were comparable. There were no significant sex or ear effects on WBA for all age groups.\n\n\n Conclusions:  Developmental effects of WBA were evident for infants during the first 6 mo of life. The WBA data can be used as a reference for detecting disorders in the sound-conductive pathways (outer and middle ear) in young infants. Further development of age-specific normative WBA data in young infants is warranted.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |Sreedevi Aithal   |Sreedevi.aithal@health.qld.gov.au |2-Jan-2023    |                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|Aithal_2014b | 2014|Sreedevi Aithal, Joseph Kei, and Carlie Driscoll |Aithal et al. |Wideband Absorbance in Australian Aboriginal and Caucasian Neonates |J Am Acad Audiol |https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25257722 |\n\n Background:  Despite the high prevalence of otitis media in Australian Aboriginal infants and children, the conductive mechanism of the outer and middle ear of Aboriginal neonates remains unclear. Differences in characteristics of the conductive pathway (outer and middle ear) between Aboriginal and Caucasian neonates have not been systematically investigated by using wideband acoustic immittance measures.\n\n\n Purpose:  The objective of this study was to compare wideband absorbance (WBA) in Australian Aboriginal and Caucasian neonates who passed or failed a screening test battery containing high-frequency tympanometry and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs).\n\n\n Research Design:  A cross-sectional study design was used. The mean WBA as a function of frequency was compared between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal neonates who passed or failed the test battery.\n\n\n Study Sample:  A total of 59 ears from 32 Aboriginal neonates (mean age, 51.9 h; standard deviation [SD], 18.2 h; range, 22–86 h) and 281 ears from 158 Caucasian neonates (mean age, 42.4 h; SD, 23.0 h; range, 8.1–152 h) who passed or failed 1000-Hz tympanometry and DPOAEs were included in the study.\n\n\n Data Collection and Analysis:    WBAresults were analyzed by using descriptive statistics and t tests with Bonferroni adjustment. An analysis of variance with repeated measures was applied to the data.\n\n\n Results:  Aboriginal and Caucasian neonates had almost identical pass rates of 61%, as determined by the test battery. Despite the apparently equal pass rates, the mean WBA of Aboriginal neonates who passed the test battery was significantly lower than that of their Caucasian counterparts at frequencies between 0.4 and 2 kHz. The mean WBA of Aboriginal neonates who failed the test battery was significantly lower than that of their Caucasian counterparts who also failed the test battery at frequencies between 1.5 and 3 kHz. Both Aboriginal and Caucasian neonates who failed the test battery had significantly lower WBA values than their counterparts who passed the test battery.\n\n\n Conclusions:  This study provided convincing evidence that Aboriginal neonates had significantly lower WBA values than their Caucasian counterparts, although both groups had equal pass rates, as determined by the test battery. Although the two ethnic groups showed significant differences in WBA, the factors contributing to such differences remain undetermined. Further research is warranted to determine the factors that might account for the difference in WBA between the two ethnic groups.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |Sreedevi Aithal   |Sreedevi.aithal@health.qld.gov.au |26-Feb-2023   |                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n|Aithal_2015 | 2015|Sreedevi Aithal, Joseph Kei, Carlie Driscoll, Asaduzzaman Khan, and Andrew Swanston |Aithal et al. |Wideband Absorbance Outcomes in Newborns: A Comparison With High-Frequency Tympanometry, Automated Brainstem Response, and Transient Evoked and Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emissions |Ear Hear |https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25951046/ |\n\n Objectives:  The purpose of this study was to evaluate the test performance of wideband absorbance (WBA) in terms of its ability to predict the outer and middle ear status as determined by nine reference standards.\n\n\n Design:  Automated auditory brainstem response (AABR), high-frequency (1000 Hz) tympanometry (HFT), transient evoked otoacoustic emission (TEOAE), and distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) tests were performed on 298 ears (144 right, 154 left) of 192 (108 males, 84 females) neonates with a mean age of 43.7 hours (SD = 21.3, range = 8.3 to 152.2 hr). WBA was measured from 0.25 to 8 kHz using clicks under ambient pressure conditions. Test performance of WBA was assessed in terms of its ability to identify conductive conditions in neonates when compared with nine reference standards (including four single tests and five test batteries) using the receiver operating characteristic analysis.\n\n\n Results:  The test performance of WBA against the test battery reference standards was better than that against single test reference standards. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve reached a high value of 0.78 for HFT + TEOAE + DPOAE and AABR + TEOAE + DPOAE reference standards. Within the ears that passed each of the reference standards, there were no significant differences in WBA. However, for the ears that failed each of the test standards, there were significant differences in WBA. The region between 1 and 4 kHz provided the best discriminability to evaluate the conductive status compared with other frequencies.\n\n\n Conclusions:  WBA is a desirable measure of conductive conditions in newborns due to its high performance in classifying ears with conductive loss as determined by the best performing surrogate gold standards (HFT + TEOAE + DPOAE and AABR + TEOAE + DPOAE).\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |Sreedevi Aithal   |Sreedevi.Aithal@health.qld.gov.au |26-Feb-2023   |                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n\n:::\n\nDESCRIBE Subjects;\n\n\nDisplaying records 1 - 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nField\nType\nNull\nKey\nDefault\nExtra\n\n\n\n\nIdentifier\nvarchar(50)\nNO\nPRI\nNA\n\n\n\nSubjectNumber\nint\nNO\nPRI\nNA\n\n\n\nSessionTotal\nint\nNO\n\nNA\n\n\n\nAgeFirstMeasurement\nfloat\nYES\n\nNA\n\n\n\nAgeCategoryFirstMeasurement\nvarchar(50)\nYES\n\nNA\n\n\n\nSex\nvarchar(50)\nNO\n\nNA\n\n\n\nRace\nvarchar(50)\nNO\n\nNA\n\n\n\nEthnicity\nvarchar(50)\nNO\n\nNA\n\n\n\nLeftEarStatusFirstMeasurement\nvarchar(50)\nNO\n\nNA\n\n\n\nRightEarStatusFirstMeasurement\nvarchar(50)\nNO\n\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSELECT *\nFROM Subjects\nWHERE Identifier = 'Lewis_2015'\nLIMIT 0, 5;\n\n\n5 records\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIdentifier\nSubjectNumber\nSessionTotal\nAgeFirstMeasurement\nAgeCategoryFirstMeasurement\nSex\nRace\nEthnicity\nLeftEarStatusFirstMeasurement\nRightEarStatusFirstMeasurement\nSubjectNotes\n\n\n\n\nLewis_2015\n1\n2\n25\nAdult\nFemale\nCaucasian\nNonHispanic\nNormal\nNormal\nRight ear: deep probe placement(session1):2.8989e-05 m^2, shallow placement(session2):4.1712e-05 m^2; Left ear data NA\n\n\nLewis_2015\n2\n2\n22\nAdult\nFemale\nCaucasian\nNonHispanic\nNormal\nNormal\nRight ear: deep probe placement(session1):3.1677e-05 m^2, shallow placement(session2):4.1669e-05 m^2; Left ear data NA\n\n\nLewis_2015\n3\n2\n37\nAdult\nFemale\nCaucasian\nNonHispanic\nNormal\nNormal\nRight ear: deep probe placement(session1):2.2295e-05 m^2, shallow placement(session2):2.9556e-05 m^2; Left ear data NA\n\n\nLewis_2015\n4\n2\n21\nAdult\nMale\nCaucasian\nNonHispanic\nNormal\nNormal\nRight ear: deep probe placement(session1):2.6597e-05 m^2, shallow placement(session2):3.3578e-05 m^2; Left ear data NA\n\n\nLewis_2015\n5\n2\n25\nAdult\nFemale\nCaucasian\nNonHispanic\nNormal\nNormal\nRight ear: deep probe placement(session1):3.6921e-05 m^2, shallow placement(session2):4.7702e-05 m^2; Left ear data NA\n\n\n\n\n\nPART 1: Recreating Voss (2020) Figure 1\nIn this part of my work, I recreated the Voss (2020) Figure 1 as closely as possible by utilizing ggplot2. I began by selecting my relevant variables, and joining via primary keys. I then isolated the data for the studies included in the plot, the desired frequencies, and grouped by the relevant variables.

In this, I grouped the data by subject race in visualization, maintaining the previous frequency threshold. I started by creating a SQL subquery for the data I desired, and visualized the mean absorbency to frequency of subjects amongst different racial groups\n\nSELECT \ns.Race, \np.Identifier,\nCOUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(m.SubjectNumber, m.Ear)) AS Unique_Ears,\nm.Frequency, \nAVG(m.Absorbance) AS Mean_Absorbance\nFROM Measurements AS m \nJOIN PI_Info AS p\nON m.Identifier = p.Identifier\nJOIN Subjects AS s ON m.SubjectNumber = s.SubjectNumber\nWHERE \np.Identifier = ('Lewis_2015')\nAND m.Frequency BETWEEN 200 AND 8000\nGROUP BY s.Race, p.Identifier, m.Frequency\nHAVING\nUnique_Ears &gt; 0;\n\n\nrace_data &lt;- race_data |&gt; \n  mutate(Race = str_trim(Race),   \n         Race = str_to_title(Race)) \n\nrace_data |&gt; \n  group_by(Race) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = Frequency, y = Mean_Absorbance, color = Race)) +\n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = \"loess\", span = 0.3) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(200, 8000), breaks = seq(200, 8000, by = 1000)) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Mean absorbance by Subject Race in Lewis 2015 Data\",\n    x = \"Frequency (Hz)\",\n    y = \"Mean Absorbance\", \n    color = \"Test Subject Race\"\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo conclude, I created subqueries of the WAI Database to best manipulate the data into visualizations using ggplot2. Although the data originated in SQL form, SQL was used to create subqueries that translate into a dataframe output in R. This was then used to create graphs via ggplot2 and tidyverse functions. In the end, a graph mimicking the output of Voss (2020) Figure 1 (with slight, noted deviations) and a graph to visualize another aspect of a specific study, Lewis 2015, differences in mean absorbency at different frequencies among subject race.\nCitation:\nVoss, Susan E., et al. “Wideband Acoustic Immittance Dataset.” Api.Openalex.Org, Smith College, api.openalex.org/works/doi:10.3837/tiis.2022.12.001.
