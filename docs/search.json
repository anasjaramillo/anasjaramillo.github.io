    "text": "Hello! I’m Ana Jaramillo, a dedicated Biology major and Mathematics & Statistics minor at Pomona College. My passion for scientific exploration has driven me to work on a range of projects, from bioinformatics research at the University of Melbourne to ecological restoration at the Bernard Field Station. I am deeply interested in the scientific research process, but have started to focus my research specialty on data analysis and computational biology. I’ve developed statistical models, analyzed large genomic datasets, and collaborated across disciplines to uncover insights into complex biological systems–such as discovering drug targets for parasitic diseases and differential bacterial/fungal microbial analyses. As a teaching assistant, I guided students in data analysis and lab techniques, nurturing the next generation of scientific thinkers. Through my work, I aim to bridge the worlds of data and biology, uncovering new knowledge and contributing to meaningful change in healthcare and genomic computational biology.\n\n\nI am currently working on a research manuscript for my senior thesis, which I hope to publish upon completion. My project focuses on investigating differential microbial assemblages in the soil beneath five native California sagescrub plant species. This research explores the microbial diversity unique to each plant species and investigates how proximity to urban boundaries—an aspect known as the “edge effect”—influences the composition of these microbial communities. By examining edge and central soil samples, I aim to uncover how human-influenced environmental factors might alter microbial ecosystems in these natural settings.\nTo achieve this, I am conducting a bioinformatics analysis on the genomic data of both fungal and bacterial assemblages. Working with tools such as Jupyter Notebook and Python, I process and analyze large genomic datasets to identify patterns and draw meaningful insights. This analysis involves a variety of computational techniques, including data cleaning, genomic sequencing alignment, and community composition visualization, providing me with hands-on experience in advanced bioinformatics workflows.\n\n\n\n\nUniversity of Melbourne Bioinformatics Research Project\nAs a research intern, I immersed myself in a project that examined gene expression patterns in Schistosoma haematobium, a parasitic organism with significant health impacts in endemic regions. This experience challenged me to bridge my biological knowledge with computational analysis, as I developed and implemented over 12 statistical models in R to interpret and visualize genomic data for over 10,000 sequences. I used the HISAT2 alignment program on the Galaxy platform to map gene expression levels across sex chromosomes, an innovative approach that broadened my understanding of bioinformatics workflows. Working alongside graduate and Ph.D. researchers, I gained firsthand experience in interdisciplinary collaboration, where I learned to refine protocols, troubleshoot data issues, and maintain data accuracy across large datasets. Presenting our findings at an international symposium was a transformative moment, teaching me to distill complex data insights into accessible, impactful narratives for a diverse scientific audience.\nSummer Undergraduate Research Program at Pomona College\nThis research experience was pivotal in expanding my understanding of ecological research design and data management. I led the sample collection and protocol design for a project exploring ecological interactions across five Southern Californian ecosystems, emphasizing precision in data collection to minimize variance across sites. I was responsible for transforming raw field data into a meaningful story that could contribute to the scientific community’s understanding of these unique environments. My contribution to our publication in Diversity included not only statistical analysis but also creating detailed data visualizations that underscored key ecological patterns and implications. Presenting our findings at academic conferences reinforced my ability to communicate scientific data visually and verbally, allowing me to advocate for ecological preservation through accessible, evidence-based presentations.\nRobert J. Bernard Field Station Research\nAt the Bernard Field Station, I engaged deeply with research on plant-soil feedback mechanisms and the ecological impact of native and invasive species, a project that aligned with my passion for biodiversity conservation. Working as a Restoration Technician, I conducted methodical data collection across 12 plots, analyzed microbial interactions, and tested soil nutrient levels. This experience brought home the importance of rigorous, repeatable research practices in ecological restoration, where every detail impacts our understanding of ecosystem health. Our team’s publication illuminated the complex interdependencies between plants, soil, and microbial communities, with my contributions to data visualization capturing the intricate relationships that promote ecosystem resilience. This project was instrumental in teaching me the real-world applications of ecological research, from laboratory techniques like DNA extraction to statistical methods that unveil hidden patterns in complex ecological datasets.\n\n\n\n\n\nCell Chemistry and Cell Biology Lab Teaching Assistant\n\nAs a Laboratory Teaching Assistant, I guided over 30 students in mastering core techniques of data analysis, visualization, and lab procedures. In this role, I emphasized precision and analytical thinking, helping students transform raw data into clear, scientifically sound reports. Leading hands-on sessions, I taught methods like western blotting, gel electrophoresis, and spectroscopy, instilling in students the importance of careful data handling. By fostering collaborative learning and critical problem-solving, I helped students build confidence in both their technical skills and their ability to interpret and present data—a foundation essential for future research and professional success.\nSkills: Western blotting, SDS-Page, agarose gel electrophoresis, spectroscopy, PCR, DNA Sequencing, DNA extraction & purification, immunofluorescence, cell culturing, transfection and transformation, knockout techniques, co-immunoprecipitation, spectroscopy, distillation, enzyme kinetic assays\n\n\n\nPosse Foundation Full-Tuition Leadership Scholarship (2021 - 2025) 1for2 Foundation “Pay-it-Forward” Scholarship ($14,700 – 2021-2025) Institute for Study Abroad Scholarship—Melbourne, Australia: Academic Year (2023) Taco Bell Live Mas Video Scholarship ($10,000 – 2021; $10,000 – 2023) 2 Published Research Articles (2022 – 2023) Hispanic Scholarship Fund Scholar (2020 – 2023)"

As the show follows multiple characters, there is some debate as to who exactly the main character is. As such, I have decided to count the amount of words spoken by each character per season to better understand who the show writers center most. Additionally, as a young adult show, there is some occasional cussing which occurs throughout. Here, I have quantified the percentage of the show script which involves cussing to see how much of the show involves potty-mouth humor.\n\n# Data\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nofficelines &lt;- read_csv(\"the-office_lines.csv\")\n\n# Cleaning Data\nofficelines &lt;- officelines |&gt;\nmutate(Line = str_to_lower(Line))\n\nlines &lt;- officelines$Line\nlines &lt;- str_remove_all(lines, \"[[:punct:]]\")\n\nofficelines &lt;- officelines |&gt;\nselect(Character, Line, Season, Episode_Number) |&gt;\nmutate(Line = lines) \n\n\nGraph 1 (Who says the most words per season?)\nCleaning data:\n\n# Homogenizing the lines\nwords_per_char &lt;- officelines |&gt;\nmutate(word_count = lengths(str_split(Line, \"\\\\s+\"))) |&gt;\ngroup_by(Character, Season) |&gt;\nsummarize(total_words = sum(word_count))\n\n#Keeping only Main Characters & Cleaning Data\nmain_characters &lt;- c(\"Michael\", \"Jim\", \"Pam\", \"Dwight\", \"Andy\", \"Ryan\", \"Robert\")\n\nwords_dont_keep &lt;- c(\"Voicemail\", \"Mom\", \"Dad\", \"Ad\", \"Fake\", \"Except\", \"Church\")\n\nword_pattern_keep &lt;- paste0(\"\\\\b(\", paste(main_characters, collapse = \"|\"), \")\\\\b\")\n\nword_pattern_delete &lt;- paste0(\"\\\\b(\", paste(words_dont_keep, collapse = \"|\"), \")\\\\b\")\n\nget_rid_ands &lt;- \"\\\\s&\\\\s|\\\\sAnd\\\\s|/|,\\\\s\"\n\nwords_per_char &lt;- words_per_char |&gt;\nfilter(str_detect(Character, word_pattern_keep)) |&gt;\nfilter(!str_detect(Character, word_pattern_delete)) |&gt;\nmutate(Character = str_replace_all(Character, get_rid_ands, \", \")) |&gt;\nseparate_rows(Character, sep = \", \") |&gt;\nfilter(str_detect(Character, word_pattern_keep)) |&gt;\nmutate(Character = case_when(\nstr_detect(Character, \"\\\\bJim\\\\b\") ~ \"Jim\",\nstr_detect(Character, \"\\\\bPam\\\\b\") ~ \"Pam\",\nstr_detect(Character, \"\\\\bDwight\\\\b\") ~ \"Dwight\",\nstr_detect(Character, \"\\\\bMichael\\\\b\") ~ \"Michael\",\nstr_detect(Character, \"\\\\bAndy\\\\b\") ~ \"Andy\",\nstr_detect(Character, \"\\\\bRobert\\\\b\") ~ \"Robert\", str_detect(Character, \"\\\\bRyan\\\\b\") ~ \"Ryan\")) |&gt;\ngroup_by(Character, Season) |&gt;\nsummarise(total_words = sum(total_words), .groups = 'drop') \n\n\n\nFinally!

Though this data visualization, you can see that Michael is the character who speaks the most (word-wise) throughout seasons 1-7. He was not present in season 8 & 9 (denoted by a lack of words). The character with the second most words throughout seasons 1-8 (except for season 4) is Dwight, who ends up having the most words in season 9. In season 8, Andy has the most words. On average Robert has no words per season, except for a slight amount of words in season 7 and more words in season 8. Ryan also has very few words throughout the show but is consistently present unlike Robert. The legend shows a color-coded labeling system for each of the main character.

    "text": "Option A: Conducting Permutation Test\nData was sourced from [Real Estate Valuation](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/477/real+estate+valuation+data+set) from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository by I-Cheng Yeh\nThis dataset shows the historical market of real estate valuation collected from Sindian Dist., New Taipei City, Taiwan. It has many interesting variables to compare–features of homes that may increase or decrease its valuation. In particular, distance from homes to the nearest MRT station interested me, as Taiwan has an extensive public transport system; MRT being one of the most popular.\nAs such, it wouldn’t be a far fetch to believe a home’s distance from an MRT station might increase valuation. As such, we might like to test the correlation between these variables to understand how significant MRT distance truly is to Taiwan’s real estate market.\nResearch Question: Is there a significant association between distance from the nearest MRT station and house price per unit area in Taiwan?\nNull Hypothesis: There is no association between the distance to the nearest MRT station and house price per unit area.\nAlternative Hypothesis: There is an association between the distance to the nearest MRT station and house price per unit area.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(readxl)\n\n# Data\nreal_estate &lt;- read_excel(\"C:/Users/anaja/Downloads/Real estate valuation data set.xlsx\")\n\nLet’s start by visualizing. I have started by plotting a graph with the dataset’s original values for MRT distance and their associated price per unit area. Clearly, the slope is pretty negative, perhaps showing that the farther a home is from an MRT station, the less expensive the price per unit area.\nHowever, how much of this is due to random chance? Could it be that all these MRT distance data points lined up just right to show a negative relationship?\nLets try to rearrange the MRT distance data randomly to see if we get the same relationship. To do so, we are sampling the existing MRT distances and assigning them randomly to house price per unit area. As we can see, the linear model shows a much more neutral slope.\n\n# Linear regression of Normal MRT Distance to House Price per Unit Area\nreal_estate |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = distance_MRT, y = house_price_unit)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  labs(x = \"Distance from MRT (meters)\", y = \"House Price of Unit Area\",\n       y = \"House Price of Unit Area\",\n       title = \"MRT Distances to House Price per Unit Area\" ) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Linear regression of Randomly Sampled MRT Distances to House Price per Unit Area\nset.seed(47)\nreal_estate |&gt;\n    mutate(random_MRT = sample(distance_MRT)) |&gt;\n    ggplot(aes(x = random_MRT, y = house_price_unit)) +\n    geom_point() +\n  labs(x = \"Distance from MRT (meters)\", y = \"House Price of Unit Area\",\n       title = \"Randomly Sampled MRT Distances to House Price per Unit Area\") +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut how much can we really trust our eyes? Lets get some numerical data to back up our claim. Here, we calculate the observed slope’s coefficient to numerically understand how much of a difference we see in slopes.\n\n# Getting the observed slope for original data and plot\nobserved_model &lt;- lm(house_price_unit ~ distance_MRT, data = real_estate)\nobserved_slope &lt;- coef(observed_model)[[\"distance_MRT\"]]\n\nobserved_slope\n\n[1] -0.007262052\n\n# Running Permutation Test with slope for Null Hypothesis\nset.seed(47)\n\npermuted_MRT_prices &lt;- function(real_estate) {\n  real_estate &lt;- real_estate |&gt;\n    mutate(random_MRT = sample(distance_MRT))\n  model_random_MRT &lt;- lm(house_price_unit ~ random_MRT, data = real_estate)\n  return(coef(model_random_MRT)[[\"random_MRT\"]])\n}\n\npermuted_MRT_prices(real_estate)\n\n[1] 0.0005357146\n\n\nOkay, but that was just ONE instance of reshuffling. Maybe this was all chance!

Thats to say, there is likely no way that our observed data would happen by chance–even if we were to run this simulation 1000 times.\nLets also conduct a t-test, just because!\n\nlibrary(broom)\nt_test &lt;- lm(house_price_unit ~ distance_MRT, data = real_estate) |&gt;\n  tidy()\n\nt_test$p.value\n\n[1] 1.856440e-231  4.639825e-56\n\n\nSince our p-values (1.856440 x 10^-231 and 4.639825 x 10^-56, essentially, 0) is much smaller than 0.05, we can confidently reject the null hypothesis–suggesting there is a statistically significant relationship between Taiwanese house prices per unit area and the home’s distance from the MRT. In all, it seems that proximity to MRT stations plays a significant role in Taiwan’s house valuation. The original data set’s negative relationship is shown to be significantly different from the 1000 iterations of permutations tested with randomized data.\nCitation:\nYeh, I. (2018).

    "text": "Data was sourced from the [Wideband Acoustic Immittance (WAI) Database](https://www.science.smith.edu/wai-database/) hosted by Smith College\nIn this project, I plan to query the WAI Database to create two sub-queries: one that will allow me to reproduce Figure 1 of the Voss (2020) publication (see image below) and one to allow me to compare mean absorbency of sound among subjects of different races in one of the studies included in the WAI Database. I start by understanding the tables within the dataset and the variables of each relevant table, which is largely done by the DESCRIBE function. I continue by joining datasets with the information relevant to the figures–utilizing primary keys that connect the datasets, such as Identifier and SubjectNumber.\nFigure 1 Voss (2020)\n\n\nlibrary(DBI)\nlibrary(RMariaDB)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\ncon_wai &lt;- dbConnect(\n  MariaDB(), host = \"scidb.smith.edu\",\n  user = \"waiuser\", password = \"smith_waiDB\", \n  dbname = \"wai\"\n)\nMeasurements &lt;- tbl(con_wai, \"Measurements\")\nPI_Info &lt;- tbl(con_wai, \"PI_Info\")\nSubjects &lt;- tbl(con_wai, \"Subjects\")\n\nPART 1: Recreating Voss (2020) Figure 1\nIn this part of my work, I recreated the Voss (2020) Figure 1 as closely as possible by utilizing ggplot2. I began by selecting my relevant variables, and joining via primary keys. I then isolated the data for the studies included in the plot, the desired frequencies, and grouped by the relevant variables. NOTE: Some deviation from the original figure results from updates in the dataset since the figure publication in 2020–4 years of additional data is included.\n\nSELECT \np.Identifier,\np.AuthorsShortList,\np.Year,\nm.Instrument,\nCOUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(m.SubjectNumber, m.Ear)) AS Unique_Ears,\nm.Frequency, \nAVG(m.Absorbance) AS Mean_Absorbance\nFROM Measurements AS m \nJOIN PI_Info AS p\nON m.Identifier = p.Identifier\nJOIN Subjects AS s ON m.SubjectNumber = s.SubjectNumber\nWHERE p.Identifier IN ('Abur_2014', 'Feeney_2017', 'Groon_2015',\n'Lewis_2015', 'Liu_2008', 'Rosowski_2012', 'Shahnaz_2006', \n'Shaver_2013', 'Sun_2016', 'Voss_1994', 'Voss_2010', \n'Werner_2010')\nAND m.Frequency BETWEEN 200 AND 8000\nGROUP BY \np.Identifier,\np.AuthorsShortList,\np.Year, m.Instrument,\nm.Frequency\nHAVING\nUnique_Ears &gt; 0\nORDER BY\np.Identifier, m.Frequency;\n\n\nfreq_data |&gt;\n  mutate(Label = paste(AuthorsShortList, \"(\", Year, \") N=\", Unique_Ears, \";\", Instrument)) |&gt;\n  group_by(Label) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(Label)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = Frequency, y = Mean_Absorbance, color = Label )) +\n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = \"loess\", span = 0.3) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(200,8000), breaks = seq(200, 8000, by = 1000)) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Mean absorbance from each publication in WAI database\",\n    x = \"Frequency (Hz)\",\n    y = \"Mean Absorbance\", \n    color = \"Study Details\"\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal()  +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\n    \"purple\", \"deepskyblue\", \"aquamarine\", \"darkolivegreen2\", \"darkseagreen1\", \"yellow\", \n    \"khaki2\", \"lemonchiffon2\", \"goldenrod1\", \"orange\", \"sienna2\", \"red\", \"tomato4\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPART 2: Mean Absorbance of Lewis 2015 Study by Subject Race\nIn this part, I chose to visualize the data of the Lewis 2015 study whose data was collected within the WAI Database. In this, I grouped the data by subject race in visualization, maintaining the previous frequency threshold. I started by creating a SQL subquery for the data I desired, and visualized the mean absorbency to frequency of subjects amongst different racial groups\n\nSELECT \ns.Race, \np.Identifier,\nCOUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(m.SubjectNumber, m.Ear)) AS Unique_Ears,\nm.Frequency, \nAVG(m.Absorbance) AS Mean_Absorbance\nFROM Measurements AS m \nJOIN PI_Info AS p\nON m.Identifier = p.Identifier\nJOIN Subjects AS s ON m.SubjectNumber = s.SubjectNumber\nWHERE \np.Identifier = ('Lewis_2015')\nAND m.Frequency BETWEEN 200 AND 8000\nGROUP BY s.Race, p.Identifier, m.Frequency\nHAVING\nUnique_Ears &gt; 0;\n\n\nrace_data &lt;- race_data |&gt; \n  mutate(Race = str_trim(Race),   \n         Race = str_to_title(Race)) \n\nrace_data |&gt; \n  group_by(Race) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = Frequency, y = Mean_Absorbance, color = Race)) +\n  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = \"loess\", span = 0.3) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(200, 8000), breaks = seq(200, 8000, by = 1000)) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Mean absorbance by Subject Race in Lewis 2015 Data\",\n    x = \"Frequency (Hz)\",\n    y = \"Mean Absorbance\", \n    color = \"Test Subject Race\"\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo conclude, I created subqueries of the WAI Database to best manipulate the data into visualizations using ggplot2. Although the data originated in SQL form, SQL was used to create subqueries that translate into a dataframe output in R. This was then used to create graphs via ggplot2 and tidyverse functions. In the end, a graph mimicking the output of Voss (2020) Figure 1 (with slight, noted deviations) and a graph to visualize another aspect of a specific study, Lewis 2015, differences in mean absorbency at different frequencies among subject race.\nCitation:\nVoss, Susan E., et al. “Wideband Acoustic Immittance Dataset.” Api.Openalex.Org, Smith College, api.openalex.org/works/doi:10.3837/tiis.2022.12.001.
